# Front-End - We Design Shopify Sites
 
Created a non-functional page for a mock website design platform, using HTML, CSS and Javascript, as well as the
Materialize CSS library for effects and styling.

This page as created as part of a test to apply for the role of Front-End developer inside my workplace,
given to me as a static Figma design and asked to be recreated with these tools over the weekend.

Although the page lacks complexity, it shows some growth from the previous project, with smoother transitions,
small animated interactions on mouse hover and the use and customization of MaterializeCSS components.
